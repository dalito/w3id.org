# Repository (italia/cultural-heritage) for redirecting to the Ontology of Digital Resource for Cultural Heritage and for providing persisent URIs for metadata related to Italian cultural heritage open datasets.

We intend to use w3id.org/italia/cultural-heritage to provide persistent URIs for the Digital Resource Ontology, developed to support the description, representation, and interoperability of master data describing digital resources related to Italian Cultural Heritage. 
The ontology is intended to be used by public administrations, cultural institutions, research initiatives, and digital platforms dealing with digital resources of cultural heritage metadata related to Italian open datasets.

The initial plan is to create:

- w3id.org/italia/cultural-heritage/onto for the ontology;
- w3id.org/italia/cultural-heritage/metadata for metadata about Italian cultural heritage datasets.

Some redirect rules will point to GitHub repositories used as semantic assets repositories, maintained by the authors.
