# Notes on used flags:
# NC - sets case-insensitive matching
# NE - noescape, prevents that special characters, such as & and ?, will be converted to their hexcode equivalent for rules that result in external redirects.
# L - last, tells mod_rewrite to stop processing further rules sets.
# R=303 - status code for "See Other". It indicates that the redirects don't link to the requested resource itself, but to another page.

# Order of rules: More specific rules must come before more general rules.
